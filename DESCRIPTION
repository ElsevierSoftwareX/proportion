Description: Multiple procedures to obtain an interval estimate for an unknown
    proportion (p) based on binomial sampling. It is known that approximations
    are poor when the true p is close to zero or to one. So we provide alternative
    procedures with better properties. Non-iterative methods widely discussed
    in litrature for computing a (central) two-sided interval estimate for p are
    implemented in terms of coverage probability and expected length.
